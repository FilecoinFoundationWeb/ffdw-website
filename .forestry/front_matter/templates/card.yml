    There are several card formats to choose from, each of which has a different visual appaerance, and may be content-specific (i.e., not all cards will always fit correctly in every section).

    For this block, we recommend card type _

    A: (deprecated)

    B: A full width card format that appears as a row, like the blog and news links throughout the site.

    C: A rectangular card which typically appears in a two-per-row format on desktop screen sizes. This is visible on the Tutorials section of the Explore page.
