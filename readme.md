## Overview

This is an early version and temporary site for the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW). 

In the interest of time, this current version simply reflects the design and is implemented with a single SVG object, and minimal interactivity.

## Build

- `develop` is the staging branch which deploys to [staging-mmfpfrmycb.ffdweb.org](//staging-mmfpfrmycb.ffdweb.org)
- `main` is the staging production branch which _will_ deploy to [ffdweb.org](//ffdweb.org)

No build necessary at the moment. This is a simple static site requiring no compilation.

Eventually this will be turned into a `nuxt` static app.
