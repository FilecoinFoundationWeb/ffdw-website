If you choose to engage in public activities on the Services, you should be aware that any information you share there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas.  You should use caution in disclosing information while participating in these areas. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these public areas.

Filecoin Foundation does permit third parties to collect the information described above through our Service and discloses such information with third parties for business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to providing advertising elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called “interest-based advertising”). The information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  

#### IV. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

By default, we do not track users or visitors to our site. We do not use cookies or similar technologies because we assume all users would prefer not to be tracked, and as such, mitigate or remove tracking at every touch point.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because we are not tracking visitors to our site, we do not take action in response to these signals.

Some browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent.

Due to differences between websites and mobile apps, you may need to take additional steps to opt out of interest based advertising for mobile applications.

We may transfer and store your information on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction.  To the extent you are a resident of a country other than the United States, UK or EEA, you consent to the transfer of such data to the United States for processing by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Some of the entities (such as third-party vendors) to which we disclose information may be located outside of the EEA or UK, including in countries that may not provide the same level of data protection or redress means as your home country.  We take appropriate steps to ensure that such personnel and third-party vendors are bound to duties of confidentiality, and the Filecoin Foundation implements measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred information, remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by contacting us at the address listed below. Where we need to transfer your data to provide you a Service, we may rely on the derogation “transfer necessary for the performance of a contract”, as permitted by law.

We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete, and current. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or current.
