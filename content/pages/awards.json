        "description": "<p>The Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is launching a request for proposals (RFP) to identify the most compelling initiatives to partner with in four key areas: <ul><li><strong>Native decentralized technology training</strong> — Train the next generation of developers so that they come into the workforce as dweb-first developers. These programs will be aimed at more junior audiences that have not yet entered the workforce full-time.</li><li><strong>Web2 to decentralized tech training</strong> — Train existing web developers to transition their Web2 skills to become decentralized technology developers. These programs will be aimed at more established audiences that are already active in the workforce and need mid-career assistance to bridge the skills gap to become dweb developers.</li><li><strong>Public education</strong> — Introduce the general public to the decentralized web. These programs will inform diverse international audiences about the values, benefits, and compelling use cases of decentralized technologies.</li><li><strong>Universities or GLAM institutions</strong> — Create a decentralized digital library of humanity’s most important information. These programs will drive the development and use of technologies to enable this decentralized library (such as industry-specific platforms that make uploading information to decentralized storage user-friendly and accessible).</li></ul></p><p>If your project or initiative would be a good fit for any of these areas, submit a completed <a href='#proposal_template' alt='FFDW proposal template'>proposal template</a> by the dates listed below. Please submit your full proposal (including attachments) in word document(s) if possible. Let us know if you have any questions! Both questions and proposals should be sent to <a href='mailto:proposals@ffdweb.org?subject=Proposal' alt='Email proposal to FFDW'>proposals@ffdweb.org</a>.</p><ul><li>RFP Launch Date: April 18th, 2022</li><li>RFP Questions Due: April 29th, 2022</li><li>RFP Answers Posted: May 6th, 2022</li><li>RFP Submissions Due and Review Begins: May 30th, 2022</li><li>RFP Review Closes: June 20th, 2022</li></ul>"
